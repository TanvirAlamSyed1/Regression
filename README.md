Here we use TensorFlow and Panda to be able to create and analyse data
A regression model predicts continuous values. This could be for housing value in a certain area or to find probabilities out
This code also outputs the loss of the computers predicitions, by using the Epoch and RMSE (root mean squared error). 
This shows the is the average squared loss per example over the whole dataset.
